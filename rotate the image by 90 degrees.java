// 1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
// bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

// // I have no clue of what's going to happen with this problem and I was trying to 
// draw something in order to figure out how to manipulate the index of the array. There
// must be a way and I just can't and dont have the time to figure that out 


// solution #1
// The rotation can be performed in layers, where you perform a cyclic swap on the edges on
// each layer. In the first for loop, we rotate the first layer (outermost edges). We rotate the
// edges by doing a four-way swap first on the corners, then on the element clockwise from the
// edges, then on the element three steps away.
// Once the exterior elements are rotated, we then rotate the interior regionâ€™s edges.

// from the exterior the the interior

class Solution {
	public static void rotate(int[][] matrix, int n) {
		for (int layer = 0; layer < n / 2; layer++) {
			int first = layer;
			int last = n - 1 - layer;
			for (int i = first; i < last; i++) {
				int offset = i - first;
				int top = matrix[first][i]; // save top
				// left -> top
				matrix[first][i] = matrix[last - offset][first];

				// bottom -> left
				matrix[last - offset][first] = matrix[last][last - offset];

				// right -> bottom
				matrix[last][last - offset] = matrix[i][last];

				// top -> right
				matrix[i][last] = top; // right <- saved top
