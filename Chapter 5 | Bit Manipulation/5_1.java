// You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
// Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M   (e.g., M
// becomes a   substring of N located at i and starting at j).
// EXAMPLE:
// Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10101, i = 2, j = 6
// Output: N = 10001010100


/*  This code operates by clearing all bits in N between position i and j, and 
then ORing to put M in there.*/
